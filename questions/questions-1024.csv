48b126e9-74b6-4b9f-8bda-27176f56045d,What happens to the cell values when a palette is removed using the RasterPaletteRemover?,The cell values are not changed, but the previously associated palette color has been removed.
0814cae7-e190-4680-96b9-fa141d4a453d,What must be done to lines for successful generation of a network topology in FME using the NetworkTopologyCalculator?,Lines must touch (be snapped) at an end vertex - first or last. Lines must be split at junctions. The TopologyBuilder can automate this process, but will not consider z-values.
d362ffa5-0ddb-4e7f-8b3b-64df97b19457,How does the FeatureMerger transformer work?,The FeatureMerger transformer merges attributes and geometry from a supplier dataset to a requestor dataset based on a matching attribute. It is used to attach crime records to street data, providing geometry and attributes for street segments.
4568ef25-a22b-4bb1-bdf2-53887846e77f,What is the purpose of the ReframeReprojector transformer?,The ReframeReprojector transformer reprojects coordinates from one coordinate system to another using the Reframe library. It is commonly used in Switzerland to transform feature coordinates.
48ee7481-923b-4173-99ea-59655664cea1,How can you define values in the FeatureJoiner transformer?,In the FeatureJoiner transformer, values can be defined by typing in a string or using functions such as attribute references, math, and string functions. Tools like the Text Editor and Arithmetic Editor help construct these values.
32261165-9f70-45a8-a6b7-db02818f03c6,What does the BinaryDecoder transformer do?,The BinaryDecoder transformer decodes Base64 or HEX text to binary data. It converts ASCII text into a sequence of bytes and sets these bytes as the value of the destination attribute. If the ASCII text represents an encoded string value, the Output Character Encoding parameter should be set to the appropriate character encoding to ensure meaningful output. If the attribute value contains invalid data, the translation will stop.
f7a3c45d-da13-4422-b5b3-8f98a6a9eba6,How does the NeighborPairFinder transformer find and handle closest features?,The NeighborPairFinder transformer finds the closest two Candidate features within a specified maximum distance of each Base feature, ensuring a minimum separation in heading between Candidates and the Base. If only one or no Candidate is found within the maximum distance, the Base feature is output unchanged. If two Candidates are found, the Base feature is output with additional attributes related to the closest and second closest Candidate features. Visual connections are provided via linear features on specific output ports.
ab7bfb2b-6b9c-4ec7-891b-33f0e76d2e82,What features does the ArcPropertySetter transformer modify?,The ArcPropertySetter transformer modifies or creates arc geometry based on specified parameters for features with arc or point geometry. Features without valid arc or point geometry or those receiving non-numeric values for numeric parameters are output through a rejection port with specific rejection codes. Parameters include settings for primary radius, secondary radius, rotation, start and end angles, start and end points, and center points. Rejected features handling can be configured to either terminate the translation or continue running.
0e8b1132-6f0d-410e-9966-4e3a7dac7c6a,What types of joins does the FeatureJoiner support?,The FeatureJoiner supports Inner, Left, and Full joins.
0e8b1132-6f0d-410e-9966-4e3a7dac7c6a,What happens to unmatched features in a Full join using the FeatureJoiner?,In a Full join, all features are output whether joined or not, including Left and Right features that did not find a match.
