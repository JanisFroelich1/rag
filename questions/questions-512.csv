RasterBandNodataSetter Sets a new Nodata value on selected bands of a raster feature. RasterBandOrderer Specifies the required order of bands in a raster. Bands are reordered according to the input band indices. RasterBandPropertyExtractor Extracts the band and palette properties of a raster feature and exposes them as attributes. RasterBandRemover Removes any selected bands from a raster feature. RasterBandSeparator Separates bands or unique band and palette combinations, and outputs either individual raster features or a single new Related Transformers: RasterCellValueCalculator, RasterCellValueRounder, RasterExpressionEvaluator, RasterSingularCellValueCalculator"

Existing texture coordinates are left unchanged. Texture Mapping Type This parameter specifies how the texture defined in an appearance style will be mapped onto the surface. This is only applicable to textures which have raster images. Surface Normal:The textures are projected onto the surfaces along their normals. For composite surfaces and meshes, each of the child parts will be treated separately, since the parts can have different normals. From Top View:The textures are projected onto the surfaces along a single normal â€“ one that is perpendicular to Related Transformers: "
