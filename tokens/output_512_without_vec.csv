FME has an extensive selection of transformers for working with raster data. They can be generally categorized as working with whole rasters, bands, cells or palettes, and those designed for workflow control or combining raster with vector data.
For information on raster geometry and properties, seeRasters (IFMERaster).

Defining Values

There are several ways to define a value for use in a Transformer. The simplest is to simply type in a value or string, which can include functions of various types such as attribute references, math and string functions, andworkspaceparameters. There are a number of tools and shortcuts that can assist in constructing values, generally available from the drop-down context menu adjacent to the value field.

Examples

In this example, we are starting with a text file (CSV) of cell signal measurements. We want to convert the entire dataset to a single point cloud.

When usingExplicit Width and Precision, consider scanning all features (Number of Features to Scan) to ensure all existing attribute value lengths are considered.

Working with Dates

Dates and times may be optionally scanned for.
If strings match the FME datetime format of%Y%m%d%H%M%Sthey may be scanned for withDetect FME Dates.
To scan for strings that match another date or time format, useConvert Input Date Format to FME Date. Note that this option is only available ifOutput Schema Before Data Featuresis set toYes.
