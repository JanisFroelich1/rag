Category: Rasters
Description: Name: RasterPaletteRemover Category: Rasters Description: How does it work?

The RasterPaletteRemover receives raster features and removes any selected palettes.
To select specific bands or palettes, use theRasterSelectorprior to the RasterPaletteRemover.
Cells are unaffected, retaining their original values.
If the source band has no palettes, the raster remains unchanged.

Examples

In this example, we have a single-band raster of land use zones, with an RGB palette. We want to remove the palette.

Note that the cell values are palette keys - in this case, a cell value of 6, which the palette associates with an RGB value.

The raster is routed into a RasterPaletteRemover.

This transformer has no parameters to configure.

The output raster feature has no palette, and theFME Data Inspectorrenders it as grayscale.

Note that the cell values are not changed, but the previously associated palette color has been removed.

In this example, we start with a single-band raster that has two palettes - one containing RGB colors, and one containing string descriptions. We want to remove the string palette. Note the band and palette

Description: Name: PointOnPointOverlayer Category: Filters and Joins, Spatial Analysis Description: Choosing a Spatial Transformer

Many transformers can assess spatial relationships and perform spatial joins - analyzing topology, merging attributes, and sometimes modifying geometry. Generally, choosing the one that is most specific to the task you need to accomplish will provide the optimal performance results. If there is more than one way to do it (which is frequently the case), time spent on performance testing alternate methods may be worthwhile.
To correctly analyze spatial relationships, all features should be in the same coordinate system. TheReprojectormay be useful for reprojecting features within theworkspace.

Description: Name: NetworkTopologyCalculator Category: Calculated Values, Spatial Analysis Description: Finds the connected lines that belong to the same network graph.

Network Topology in FME

In order to successfully generate a network topology, some conditions must be met.
Lines must touch (be snapped) at anend vertex- first or last.
Lines must be split at junctions. TheTopologyBuildercan automate this process, but will not consider z-values (and so may not produce correct results for overpasses/underpasses, for example.)
A junction at an interior vertex (not an end vertex) produces acomplex edge, which is not supported.

Category: Calculated Values
Description: Name: StatisticsCalculator Category: Calculated Values Description: countwhere # is a zero-based index of the unique attribute values.

Input Data Handling

Invalid, <null>, and <missing> data are considered invalid and will be skipped when calculating statistics other than total count. If no valid values are processed when calculating a statistic the result will be <null>. Trying to calculate standard deviation on only one value will also result in <null>. Total count, numeric count, and value count will never be <null>. NaN values are explicitly ignored when calculating Min, Max, Range, and Numeric Count.
For example, a calculated sum on all <missing> values will be <null> rather than a potentially misleading and less informative 0. However, if only some values are <missing> or invalid the resulting sum will be the same as if those values were 0.

Usage Notes

The StatisticsCalculator transformer has default suffixes and always prepends. Upgraded transformers will retain prepend settings when output attribute names were not prepended before upgrade as well as suffix names to maintain backwards compatibility and avoid disrupting existingwork

Typical Uses

How does it work?

The CoordinateRounder receives features and rounds their x, y, and/or z coordinates to a specified precision.
X,Y, andZ Precisionparameters are specified as integers, and may be entered directly or set to an expression, user parameter, attribute, or conditional value. Positive numbers represent the number of decimal places to round to, and negative numbers produce rounding to multiples of ten (10). A precision of zero (0) produces integers - coordinates with no decimal places.
If any of thePrecisionparameters are left blank, those coordinates will pass through unaltered.
For arcs, only the start and end points are rounded, as these are the only coordinates which lie on the path of the arc. The center point is not rounded, nor are any other of the arc's parameters.

If this is not the case - for example, if the horizontal units are in meters with elevation (z) in feet (or any other similar unit type mismatch), you may apply a scale factor (also known as Z Factor) with theScalertransformer prior to using a RasterHillshader.
In that example (ground units are meters, elevations are feet), the scale factor to use is 0.3048 - the number of meters in one foot.
If the ground units are decimal degrees (lat/long), the appropriate scale factor will vary greatly between the equator and the poles. In this case, consider reprojecting the input raster with aReprojector, to an appropriate coordinate system with ground units matching the vertical (z) units.
If units are mismatched, the transformer may complete processing, but will produce incorrect or unexpected results.

To produce a digital elevation model in either points or raster format, see theDEMGeneratororRasterDEMGenerator.
It is important to note that if the only thing you want to do with an existing surface model is output information, then you must route a feature into the surface model. The easiest way to do this is to simply use theCreatortransformer and route a single feature with a null geometry into theDrapeFeaturesinput port.

The RasterCellValueReplacer receives raster features. Each band value of each cell is compared to a defined set of numeric ranges, and values that match a range definition are replaced with a new, single defined value.
Ranges are defined in aRange Table, usingFromandToparameters, which may be combined in a variety of ways. If both parameters are defined, both are applied. These examples assume that the band values are integers.

Category: 3D, Cartography and Reports, Rasters
Description: Name: RasterHillshader Category: 3D, Cartography and Reports, Rasters Description: How does it work?

The RasterHillshader receives elevation raster features and creates a shaded relief representation, derived from slope and aspect calculated on the input elevation values.
The input raster’s horizontal and vertical units are expected to be the same.
Input band(s) are converted to GRAY8, with hillshade values between 0 and 255. The position of the light source may be adjusted, and a choice of algorithms is available.
If the input band has a Nodata value set, or ifInterpolate Nodatais set toNo, an ALPHA8 band is also generated, with a cell value of 0 (fully transparent) where the input was Nodata and a value of 255 (fully opaque) where the input was data.
Interpolate Nodata means that Nodata values will be replaced with actual values, calculated from the neighboring cells. WhenInterpolate Nodatais set toYes, there are no Nodata cells, and so no alpha band is required.
This transformer supports raster band selection. TheRasterSelectorcan be used to modify this selection.

Category: Strings
Description: Name: BinaryDecoder Category: Strings Description: Decodes Base64 or HEX text to binary data.
The transformer converts the ASCII text into a sequence of bytes, and then sets these bytes as the value of the destination attribute.  If the ASCII text represents an encoded string value, use theOutput Character Encodingparameter to set the character encoding of the output attribute.
For example, if the encoding string was produced from a UTF-8 string, the Character Encoding parameter should be set to UTF-8, or the string value will not be meaningful in other transformers.  If no character encoding is selected, the attribute is tagged as containing binary data.
If the attribute value contains invalid data (that is, the attribute value was not properly encoded using the selected encoding method), the translation will stop.

Sorting becomes more difficult according to the number of data streams.

There are two typical reasons for usingWhen Group Changes (Advanced). The first is incoming data that is intended to be processed in groups (and is already so ordered). In this case, the structure dictatesGroup Byusage - not performance considerations.
The second possible reason is potential performance gains.
Performance gains are most likely when the data is already sorted (or read using aSQL ORDER BYstatement) since less work is required of FME. If the data needs ordering, it can be sorted in theworkspace(though the added processing overhead may negate any gains).
Sorting becomes more difficult according to the number of data streams. Multiple streams of data could be almost impossible to sort into the correct order, since all features matching aGroup Byvalue need to arrive before any features (of any feature type or dataset) belonging to the next group.

Many transformers can assess spatial relationships and perform spatial joins - analyzing topology, merging attributes, and sometimes modifying geometry. Generally, choosing the one that is most specific to the task you need to accomplish will provide the optimal performance results.

Working With Coordinate System Transformers

FME inherently supports coordinate system transformations and reprojections.
Coordinate systems generally have a name and a definition, and the syntax of that definition can vary greatly between both spatial data formats and other coordinate system libraries. Custom and local coordinate systems can also be defined in FME, further complicating matters. For in-depth information, see theWorking With Coordinate Systemsdocumentation.
Reprojections are generally done with the FME Reprojection Engine, which is based on the CS-Map coordinate system library. This default can be overridden on a per-workspacebasis, using theWorkspace Parameters > Translation > Reprojection Engineparameter, and set to Esri. Where appropriate, FME will use the Esri Reprojection Engine if it is selected there, with or without an Esri product being installed.

For example, it the outermost JSON element is an object with a key and ""address"" whose value is an object containing keys ""city"" and ""province"", then these values can be referred to by the expressions json[""address""][""city""] and json[""address""][""province""].
In order to refer to all of the values in an array or object, a wildcard index * can be used. For example, if the outermost JSON element is an array, then the expression json[*] refers to every element in the array.
JSON Property Expressions
A property expression is a structure expression as described above, followed by a . (dot) operator and a property name. Currently, the only supported properties are type and size. The type property returns the type of the JSON value referred to by the JSON structure expression. For example, if the outermost JSON element is an array, and the first element of the array is a string, then the expression json[0].type would have a value of string.

Defining Values

There are several ways to define a value for use in a Transformer. The simplest is to simply type in a value or string, which can include functions of various types such as attribute references, math and string functions, andworkspaceparameters.

A template may call many sub-templates.  For example, in the above example, we could add another sub-template named BUSINESS, and then used the process-features function to run this sub-template from theRoottemplate.  Additionally, a sub-template may run another sub-template, with the restriction that a sub-template may not directly or indirectly run itself.

However, since objects are being looked for at a more granular scale, the transformer might take longer to process the raster. With higher granularity also comes a potential for more noise or false-positive detections and other transformer parameters might help reduce those. The opposite is also true for larger scaling factors.
Minimum Number of Neighbors
When a detection (kernel) window is being moved across the raster, an object might be detected multiple times in the same area. These similar area detections are called neighbors.Minimum Number of Neighborsspecifies how many neighbors each candidate detected object requires before it as accepted as a valid detected object.  The default is 2 neighbors.
When theMinimum Number of Neighborsis 0, all detected objects will be retained. Therefore, the confidence in each match will be low.
When theMinimum Number of Neighborsis greater than 0, the algorithm will retain a detected object only if it has at least the specified number of neighbors, thus incr

Defining Values

There are several ways to define a value for use in a Transformer. The simplest is to simply type in a value or string, which can include functions of various types such as attribute references, math and string functions, andworkspaceparameters. There are a number of tools and shortcuts that can assist in constructing values, generally available from the drop-down context menu adjacent to the value field.

Category: Calculated Values, Rasters
Description: Name: RasterExpressionEvaluator Category: Calculated Values, Rasters Description: How does it work?

The RasterExpressionEvaluator receives raster features and evaluates defined expressions using the cell values, then outputs new raster features with the calculated values.

Input Mode - One or Two Rasters

The transformer has two modes -One RasterandTwo Rasters.
One Rastermode provides a single input port -theAport. In this mode, expressions will be evaluated wholly within a single raster.
Two Rastersmode provides two input ports -AandB. In this mode, expressions can use cell values from two rasters of the same dimensions (same number of rows and columns). Position information for georeferenced rasters isnottaken into consideration. The number of input raster features may be:
All bands used in the same expression must have the same Nodata value, or have no Nodata value at all. No band may have a palette.
InTwo Rastermode, if an expression references both theAandBinput raster features, the output raster will have all the attributes from both featureAandB. If the same attribute exists on both input features, then the attribute value from featureBwill be preferred.

The PointOnLineOverlayer compares points and lines, splitting the lines where a point falls on (or within a specified distance of) the lines. Each resulting new line may receive the attributes of the points that matched the original line, and points may receive attributes from the lines (a spatial join). Features (points and lines) also receive a count of the number of matches encountered.
Aggregates can either be deaggregated before processing or rejected. Intersections between linear features are not computed.

The station points are close to the lines, but not right on them - generally within a meter.

The stations are connected to thePointinput port, and the routes are connected to theLineinput port.

Category: Data Quality
Description: Name: Matcher Category: Data Quality Description: How does it work?

The Matcher can receive any number of input feature streams. All features are compared against all other features, and matches are identified based on the parameters defined.
Options for matching include geometry and/or attributes, and you may also define attributes that must differ.
All features that find a match are output via theMatchedport (that is, if two features match each other, both of them are output here). Each set of matches is given a new numeric Match ID attribute that can be used to identify them as a matching group.
A single copy of each set of matched features is sent to theSingleMatchedport. The attributes on these features are merged on to one output feature. Using this port, the Matcher is capable of doing multi-feature merging using geometry as the key. This complements theFeatureMerger, which only accepts attributes, and not geometries, as keys.
Features that do not find a match are output via theNotMatchedport.

Category: Workflows
Description: Name: PythonCreator Category: Workflows Description: How does it work?

The PythonCreator creates features using the Python script supplied, and sends them into theworkspacefor processing.
The Python script must be in the form of a Python class. The features can be created either in theinput()orclose()methods.
Features created in theinput()method are createdbeforethe first reader is processed. Features created in theclose()method are createdafterall reader features have been processed.
Features are created  via theFME Objects Python API.
Using Python to perform arbitrary operations on features is a powerful aspect ofFME Workbench. However, the logic introduced into aworkspaceis less visible and can therefore be more difficult to maintain than logic built usingFME Workbench’s built-in transformers. It is recommended that other transformers be used when possible instead of Python scripts.

Editing Transformer Parameters

Using a set of menu options, transformer parameters can be assigned by referencing other elements in theworkspace. More advanced functions, such as an advanced editor and an arithmetic editor, are also available in some transformers. To access a menu of these options, clickbeside the applicable parameter. For more information, seeTransformer Parameter Menu Options.

Defining Values

There are several ways to define a value for use in a Transformer. The simplest is to simply type in a value or string, which can include functions of various types such as attribute references, math and string functions, andworkspaceparameters. There are a number of tools and shortcuts that can assist in constructing values, generally available from the drop-down context menu adjacent to the value field.

Category: Cartography and Reports, Rasters
Description: Name: ImageRasterizer Category: Cartography and Reports, Rasters Description: How does it work?

The ImageRasterizer receives point, line, and area geometries or point clouds, and “draws” them onto a single output raster feature.
For vector input features, thefme_colorattribute determines the pixel color in the raster. Line weights are not supported, and features will be drawn at a width of one (1) pixel.
Polygon features that do not have a fill color defined (fme_fill_color) will be filled with their outline color (fme_color).
For point clouds, pixel coloring may be done using either the color or intensity component.
Background fill color, alpha value, and Nodata options are available, as well as anti-aliasing. A variety of options is available for raster interpretation, including RGB variants, gray scales, and single color and alpha bands.
The size of the output raster may be defined by number of rows and columns, or by specifying the size of a single cell (pixel) in ground units. The geographic extent covered by the raster may be either determined by the input features or manually specified.

Category: Calculated Values
Description: Name: LeftRightSpatialCalculator Category: Calculated Values Description: d (particularly with multiple, equally-sized groups), but could cause undesired behavior if input groups are not truly ordered.
There are two typical reasons for usingWhen Group Changes (Advanced). The first is incoming data that is intended to be processed in groups (and is already so ordered). In this case, the structure dictatesGroup Byusage - not performance considerations.
The second possible reason is potential performance gains.
Performance gains are most likely when the data is already sorted (or read using aSQL ORDER BYstatement) since less work is required of FME. If the data needs ordering, it can be sorted in theworkspace(though the added processing overhead may negate any gains).
Sorting becomes more difficult according to the number of data streams. Multiple streams of data could be almost impossible to sort into the correct order, since all features matching aGroup Byvalue need to arrive before any features (of any feature type or dataset) belonging to the next group. In this case, usingGroup BywithWhen All Features Receivedmay be the equivalent and simpler approach.
