Description: This parameter is only available when the region bounding box is being calculated from the bounding box of the feature geometry.  It may be used to make the bounding box of the KML region larger (or smaller) than the bounding box of the geometry. The geometry bounding box will be expanded (or decreased if the value is negative) on all sides, by the value of the parameter.  The parameter value should be given in degrees of latitude/longitude.

Name: RasterObjectDetector
Category: Rasters
Description: Name: RasterObjectDetector
Category: Rasters
Description: When a detection (kernel) window is being moved across the raster, an object might be detected multiple times in the same area. These similar area detections are called neighbors.Minimum Number of Neighborsspecifies how many neighbors each candidate detected object requires before it as accepted as a valid detected object.  The default is 2 neighbors.
